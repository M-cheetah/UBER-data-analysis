# UBER-data-analysis :cherry_blossom:
> **Data analysis on UBER's data of ride calls from travellers** 

***I used simple python functions to get really facinating results from the data. After analysing the data we got the following output results.***
- Generated the map of the place where data belong to.
- Generated heatmap of the user requesting for rides over the week.
- Generated the hourly, day wise, weekly and monthly plots of user requests.
- Although it was not tod in the data that to what place the data belong to, but still we were able to get the location of the place where data belongs to, *it was **Manhattan*** :trollface:.
